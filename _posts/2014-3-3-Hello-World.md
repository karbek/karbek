title: Create a simple HTML5 game - Hit the mole
---

To dive into HTML5 game development, we create a simple "hit the mole" game. The game 5 molehills and a mole appearing each time from behind one molehill. If you can hit him, you get some points.


The game ist playable in the web browser and on mobile devices, as well. The complete source code can be found on github: https://github.com/physalisio/HitTheMole.git


Our first step is to create an index.html web page containing the game.


```html
<head>
<script> var k = function(){
  l ="efsdfasD";
}
<body>
```
